# This file contains the general settings for the PUT Driver
# disable_flags: if set to true the corresponding finger will NOT be activated in the real hardware. However all calls to it will be answered in the
#                most positive way so it appears to be working. This is meant to be used if a specific finger has a hardware fault
# finger_reset_speed: percent of the full finger speed to use during reset. Use values between 0.0 and 1.0
# reset_timeout: seconds after which a reset of a finger is aborted if no values change.
#                (Note if the current changes slighty even if a finger is stuck it will not be registered as a timeout)
